Game for 1 Game a Month Jam

# Project Summery
This project was a simple text-based game developed by a small group for the 1 Game a Month Jam. The text is complemented by a music track and visuals, to showcase the skills of different group members. The game is a simple maze with a horror theme. The player attempts to navigate a corn maze with an unintuitive room layout. This project leveraged the TADS game engine.

# Project Context
This game was developed in the spare time of a group of students. As such, the standards for the project were intentionally set low. The decision was made to develope a text based game, with audio and visual enhancements, as that could be realistically developed in a few hours of spare time.

# Lessons
The programmers decided to utilize the TADS engine for text based games. Working with this engine was difficult at times as the setup of the environment was not straightforward. A better engine could have likely been found with more research.
